## MiraVariable: A VertexAI Google Cloud Platform Project on Mira Variables

**Overview**

MiraVariable is a VertexAI Google Cloud Platform project that aims to develop and deploy machine learning models to better understand and predict the behavior of Mira variable stars. Mira variables are a class of pulsating stars that are characterized by their very red colors, pulsation periods longer than 100 days, and amplitudes greater than one magnitude in infrared and 2.5 magnitude at visual wavelengths. They are red giants in the very late stages of stellar evolution, on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), that will expel their outer envelopes as planetary nebulae and become white dwarfs within a few million years.

**Goals**

The goals of the MiraVariable project are to:

* Develop machine learning models to predict the pulsation period of Mira variables.
* Identify physical parameters of Mira variables, such as mass, radius, and temperature, from their light curves.
* Discover new Mira variables using data from large-scale surveys.
* Develop a web-based tool for astronomers to visualize and explore Mira variable data.

**Methodology**

The MiraVariable project will use a variety of machine learning techniques, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning will be used to train models to predict the pulsation period of Mira variables. Unsupervised learning will be used to identify physical parameters of Mira variables and discover new Mira variables. Reinforcement learning will be used to develop a web-based tool for astronomers to visualize and explore Mira variable data.

**Data**

The MiraVariable project will use data from a variety of sources, including:

* The American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) Photometric All-Sky Survey (APASS)
* The Gaia mission
* The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)
* The Vera Rubin Observatory (VRO)

**Impact**

The MiraVariable project is expected to have a significant impact on the study of Mira variable stars. The development of machine learning models to predict the pulsation period of Mira variables will enable astronomers to better understand the physics of these stars and their evolution. The identification of physical parameters of Mira variables from their light curves will provide astronomers with new insights into the structure and composition of these stars. The discovery of new Mira variables will expand our knowledge of the distribution of these stars in the Milky Way
